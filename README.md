# OOG 

This tools aim to be a helper to open files at the GitHub or GitLab page without
going and try to search it in their UI. 

I made this because I was switching throught a lot of files daily and sometimes
I wanted to see them on GitHub because of the jump to code feature. 

This tool is mostly useless.
